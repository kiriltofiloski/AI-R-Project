# AI-R-Project
This is a team project for the Artficial Intelligence course at the FRI faculty. 

For this project we were given a dataset containing energy usage for different types of buildings throughout the year of 2016. Using R, we implemented and compared various predictive models to find the best prediction for future energy usage, while also creating additional attributes and data visualizations.
